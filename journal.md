my thoughts on The new cell phone police are mixed, im well adjust to the new phone police but not beang abel to use my phone wene i finish my worck makes may day boring and exhausting, also students that can't use there phons to correct words that they can't right or spell making them dificult to understand. For sumone like me whos first langueg is'int english it gets dificult for me to right a word let alon a sentence but at the same time students get to focus more on school in sted of just waching there phons all day or cheating using AI. I have a feeling that it's a good idea to band phons in school beacuse of AI or not duing work but at the same time I have nothing to do wene I finish work and it's boring buting yore head down.
