It is inportant to protect your personal information wen publishing sumthing on line because ther culd be people thst want your information 
to steal, rob, or stalk you. Ther is a way you can secure your information you share on platforms and one of the methots you can yous is by 
blocking other people that feel like ther stalking you or dont post sumthin that is way to personal for you.
