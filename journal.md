the more signal it sends out.if you Put it in front of a vibration motor it will control how much the sphero shakes.

It is inportant to protect your personal information wen publishing sumthing on line because ther culd be people thst want your information 
to steal, rob, or stalk you. Ther is a way you can secure your information you share on platforms and one of the methots you can yous is by 
blocking other people that feel like ther stalking you or dont post sumthin that is way to personal for you.
For me, I have never bin in social medi that much and never posted sumthing personal about me.
Working with others while still protecting your privacy can be dificult to do becaus you cant reale trust the person you're working with.
